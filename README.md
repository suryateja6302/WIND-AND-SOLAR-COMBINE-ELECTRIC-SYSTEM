Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are directed towards a hybrid electric system for generating electric energy, comprising a photovoltaic system 
comprising one or more solar panels configured to convert sunlight into electricity and stores in a battery system. A wind turbine/wind miller configured to generate 
wind energy and stores in the battery system. The wind turns propeller-like blades of the wind turbine around a rotor, which spins a generator, which creates electricity. 

The battery system configured to store electric energy generated through the photovoltaic system and the wind turbine. A processing device is as an interface for the 
wind turbine/wind miller and the photovoltaic system. The photovoltaic system and the wind turbine configured to provide a direct current of electricity from either or 
both wind and solar energy at day and night.
